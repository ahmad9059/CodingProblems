# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning and mastering DSA concepts by solving problems from various platforms such as LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and InterviewBit.

## Motivation

The primary objective of this repository is to serve as a centralized hub for storing my solutions to DSA problems. By maintaining this repository, I aim to:

- Enhance my understanding of fundamental DSA concepts.
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills by tackling diverse challenges.
- Document my progress and track improvements over time.
- Share knowledge and collaborate with fellow learners and enthusiasts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each corresponding to a different platform:

- **leetcode**: Contains solutions to problems from LeetCode.
- **geeksforgeeks**: Contains solutions to problems from GeeksforGeeks.
- **interviewbit**: Contains solutions to problems from InterviewBit.

Within each platform folder, you'll find subfolders categorizing problems based on their respective topics. The topics may include, but are not limited to, arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.

## Contribution

Your contributions and feedback are highly appreciated! If you have suggestions for improving existing solutions, want to contribute new solutions, or have any questions related to DSA, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the world of DSA or looking to brush up on your skills, here's how you can get started:

1. **Explore the Problems**: Browse through the folders and select a problem that interests you.
2. **Read the Problem Statement**: Understand the problem statement and its constraints carefully.
3. **Solve the Problem**: Attempt to solve the problem on your own.
4. **Compare Solutions**: Compare your solution with the provided solutions in this repository.
5. **Learn and Improve**: Analyze different approaches and learn from them to improve your problem-solving skills.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, InterviewBit, and other platforms for providing a platform to practice and hone DSA skills. Additionally, I'm thankful to the open-source community for sharing knowledge and resources that have contributed to my learning journey.

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and contribute to this repository. Let's embark on this DSA journey together and strive for continuous improvement!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
