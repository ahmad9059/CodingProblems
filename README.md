# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and InterviewBit. I'm actively learning DSA concepts and sharpening my problem-solving skills through consistent practice.

## Folder Structure

- **leetcode**: Contains solutions to problems from LeetCode.
- **geeksforgeeks**: Contains solutions to problems from GeeksforGeeks.
- **interviewbit**: Contains solutions to problems from InterviewBit.

Within each of these main folders, you'll find subfolders categorizing problems based on their topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, queues, etc.

Feel free to explore the solutions and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
